            In this example, the condition is based on the "ALLOW_TO_INSTALL" property (see below in this file):
                - if it is "yes", the installer is allowed to continue;
                - any other value will prevent the installer to continue.
            
            If the condition is false, the text from the "Message" attribute is displayed to the user.
